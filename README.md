Used this website to learn about elements that are considered part of semantics for HTML and CSS such as li, nav, section. This website was used as reference for html and css for the challenge.

    2. Used github.com (url- https://github.com/mattcone/markdown-guide/blob/master/_basic-syntax/line-breaks.md) to refer on how to use line break in orer to use it within the Readme.md file
